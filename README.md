## Overview

## The Yandex Yambda Dataset

The Yandex Yambda dataset is a large-scale music dataset containing billions of user-track interactions from millions of users. 
It includes both implicit (listens) and explicit (likes/dislikes) feedback and precomputed audio embeddings for millions of tracks. 
The dataset is available in multiple scales (50M, 500M, 5B interactions) in Parquet format.  
More details about the dataset can be found here: [Yandex Yambda dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yandex/yambda)

The files contain:
- **`multi_event.parquet`:** a unified table including multiple types of interactions (`listen`, `like`, `unlike`, `dislike`, `undislike`). This file may contain `null` values and is not cleaned.
- **single-event records:** cleaned file for each event type with user-song interactions of that type
- **audio embeddings:** pre-computed audio embedding
- **song mappings:** song-album mapping and song-artist mapping

---

## Setup and Requirements:

Ensure your environment has enough disk space for the dataset size you plan to download (`50m`, `500m`, or `5b`).

Install the required Python packages. For GPU setups:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas torch faiss-gpu typing-extensions scikit-learn
```

### Installing PyTorch

For GPU, make sure to install the correct version that matches your CUDA setup.
Example for CUDA 12.1:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

### Installing PyTorch Geometric

PyTorch Geometric requires additional dependencies that must match your PyTorch and CUDA versions.
Follow the official guide to install all necessary packages:
[pytorch-geometric installation instructions](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html)

## Configuration

a `config.py` file sets the save directories and dataset parameters for the download

---

## Project Pipeline

### Stage 1: Downloading the Dataset

The code downloads the Yambda dataset from Hugging Face's `datasets` library using the provided wrapper class.
All the interaction files and metadata available in this dataset are saved in parquet format.

```bash
python yambda_download.py
```

The dataset size, type and save directory are set in the `config.py` file. Example:

```python
# config.py
DATASET_SIZE = "50m"        # Options: "50m", "500m", "5b"
DATASET_TYPE = "flat"       # Options: "flat", "sequential"
DATA_DIR = f"project_data/YambdaData{DATASET_SIZE}/"
```

We also offer additional scripts to inspect the downloaded files and compute basic statistics:

#### 1. Inspect

saves a CSV file containing the columns names and first row of each file in the same save directory as the data.

```bash
python project_data/yambda_inspect.py
```

#### 2. Basic Statistics

saves a CSV file containing a basic statistics about each interaction file in the same save directory as the data.

```bash
python project_data/yambda_stats.py
```


### Stage 2: Preparing the Data for the GNN

Run the preparation pipeline:

```bash
python run_GNN_prep.py
```

#### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Defines weights for each event type.
- Calculates listen counts per song for each user.
- Encodes user and track IDs.
- Saves a new Parquet file `interactions.parquet` with all event records.

#### 2. Split Data

- Splits user interactions (users with â‰¥5 interactions) into train, validation, and test datasets.
- Saves `train.parquet`, `val.parquet`, and `test.parquet`.

#### 3. Build Graph

- Builds a bipartite graph with users and songs as nodes and interactions as weighted edges.
- Saves the graph as a PyTorch file graph.pt.


All outputs are saved to the directory specified in `config.py` as `PROCESSED_DIR`. Example:

```python
# config.py
PROCESSED_DIR = "final_project/processed_data/"
```

### Stage 3: GNN modelling and training


### Stage 4: ANN search and retrieval

## Notes

- Dataset size options:
  - `50m`: lightweight, suitable for experiments.
  - `500m`: medium-scale dataset.
  - `5b`: full dataset, very large and resource-intensive.
